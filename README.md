# JIS-sequence-generator
As a personal coding challenge I will regularly refactor a small piece of this embarassingly ugly - yet sufficiently functional - piece of code I've written years ago for academic purposes. 

The app generates data for simulation experiments with a Just-in-Sequence (JIS) delivery model. The sequences in which the different types of product are to be assembled and delivered are generated randomly using several input parameters, e.g. base quantities, demand curve, deviations, etc. The output data is then written to .xls-sheets (the simulation program wants it so).
